After the trauma they caused Lucas would not allow a collar on his neck who could blame him. Good news we brought Luca to the best trainer in LA and Luca walks on a Kesha and wares the right gear. Lucas would love all the love he missed out in as a baby. Lucas would love to be your only dog, he has so much live to give. He loves to be loved he gets so happy when he is being petted and he loves his belly rubs. He is local to LA and sorry we donâ€™t ship dogs out of state. He is truly incredible and deserves a loving experienced bully breed owner.")
